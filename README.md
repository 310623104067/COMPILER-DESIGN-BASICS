This program parses and evaluates basic arithmetic expressions using recursive descent parsing. It handles:

Addition (+) and Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*) and Division (/)

Parentheses for grouping

Floating-point numbers

The expression is stored as a string.

index keeps track of which character is being processed.

If it finds (, it recursively evaluates the expression inside the parentheses
.
Otherwise, it returns a number.

*Operator precedence: * and / have higher precedence than + and -.

* Parentheses support: Allows grouping of expressions.
  
* Floating-point arithmetic: Supports decimal numbers like 3.14.
  
* Error handling: Detects invalid input and prevents crashes.
